"""
Claude Code round-robin scheduler.

Runs continuously, independent of the dashboard web app. Cycles through
whichever projects are currently selected (state/selected_projects.json,
written by the dashboard) and keeps up to MAX_CONCURRENT of them active at
once (each in its own tmux/Claude Code session) so one project stuck
waiting on a human response doesn't block every other selected project
from being picked up. For each active project:

  1. Check its _Requests/ folder for READY items (cheap -- just a
     directory listing + first-line reads, no Claude session needed for
     this part). See common.py / _Instructions/Requests.md for exactly
     what counts as "ready".
  2. If there are pending items: make sure that project's tmux/Claude
     Code session is running (start it if not), send it a prompt to
     process the requests, then loop back and check again shortly after.
  3. If empty: wait EMPTY_GRACE_SECONDS and check once more.
  4. If still empty on that second check: hibernate the session (kill
     the tmux session to free RAM) and free the slot for the next
     selected project with pending work.
  5. If nothing was ever running for this project, just move on straight
     away -- no point spawning Claude just to confirm there's nothing to
     do.

Writes its current state to state/scheduler_state.json so the dashboard
can display it, and appends transition events to state/activity_log.jsonl
so the dashboard can show a status log.

Run:
  python3 scheduler.py
(intended to run as a systemd service -- see ../systemd/bdrdev-scheduler.service)
